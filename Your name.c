Sure! Here's a simple C program that uses printf() to display your name, age, and location:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Replace the values with your actual details
    printf("Name: John Doe\n");
    printf("Age: 25\n");
    printf("Location: New York, USA\n");
    return 0;
}

You can change "John Doe", 25, and "New York, USA" to your actual name, age, and location.

Would you like the program to take user input instead?
